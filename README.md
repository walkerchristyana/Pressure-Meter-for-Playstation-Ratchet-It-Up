# Pressure-Meter-for-Playstation-Ratchet-It-Up
Mindscape is a psychological horror game built around interpretation rather than correctness. The player assumes the role of a Mind Doctor tasked with entering psychological environments (“mindscapes”) and observing how those spaces react under scrutiny. Instead of uncovering objective truth, the player applies pressure through dialogue and observation, causing the environment itself to respond. The game emphasizes discomfort, uncertainty, and the consequences of confident misinterpretation.

The experience is designed as a short, replayable narrative game with multiple endings determined by how accurately the player interprets environmental signals rather than how much information they extract from characters.

Core Mechanic: The Pressure Meter
The Pressure Meter is the primary tool used throughout the game. It does not measure character emotions or honesty. Instead, it interprets how the room responds to the player’s actions. The meter tracks four environmental signals:

Threat Presence — how hostile or dangerous the environment has become

Awareness — how conscious the space is of the player’s presence

Stability — how coherent and grounded the environment remains

Resistance — how strongly the environment pushes back against interpretation

As the player asks questions, the room reacts through visual distortion, intrusive text, audio cues, and looping dialogue. These responses serve as feedback for the Pressure Meter, reinforcing that observation itself alters the state of the environment.

Scoring System
Scoring in Mindscape is proximity-based rather than binary. At the end of each subject’s investigation, the player submits numerical readings (0–10) for each Pressure Meter signal. These values are compared against the room’s true internal state, which is hidden during gameplay.

Points are awarded based on how close the player’s interpretation is to the actual value:

Perfect matches score highest

Near matches score moderately

Large deviations score low or zero

Each subject can award a maximum of 16 points, for a total possible score of 32 across the full game. Confident but incorrect readings are penalized more heavily than cautious approximations, reinforcing the game’s core theme that certainty increases pressure.

Endings

The final ending is determined by the player’s cumulative score and the presence of zero-point readings.

Clean Exit (Good Ending):
Total score 26–32, with no zero-point categories

Contained:
Moderate accuracy with limited misreads

Fracture:
Frequent confident misinterpretation causing environmental damage

Breach:
Severe misreads and zero-point categories; the environment overtakes the player

There is no “perfect” ending. Each outcome reflects how the environment adapted to the player’s approach.

Language & Tone

The game’s language is intentionally unsettling and indirect. Dialogue avoids exposition and traditional interrogation structures, favoring fragmented responses, repetition, and environmental interruption. Intrusive text, corrupted hints, and takeover messages are used to externalize psychological pressure rather than communicate objective facts.

Language is treated as a mechanic:

Accusatory phrasing increases Resistance

Forced certainty destabilizes the environment

Silence and hesitation are interpreted as actions

This approach reinforces the idea that meaning is imposed, not discovered.

Audio & Visual Design

The visual design uses a red-and-black palette with CRT-inspired effects, scanlines, and vignette overlays to evoke a distorted, game-like interface. Screen transitions are treated as “room shifts” rather than simple page changes.

Audio is reactive and minimal:

Ambient drones suggest awareness

Stings and heartbeats signal pressure spikes

Whispers and static represent corrupted perception

All sounds are intentionally brief or looped to avoid desensitization.

Controls & Play Environment

The game is designed to run in a web browser. For best results:

Run using a local server (python3 -m http.server)

Use headphones for full audio effect

Avoid rushing dialogue; pacing affects perception

Design Philosophy

Mindscape explores the psychological cost of interpretation. It rejects the idea that observation is neutral or that truth is inherently stabilizing. By framing scoring as approximation rather than correctness, the game encourages restraint, humility, and awareness of how systems respond to pressure.

In Mindscape, the player does not solve the room.
They teach it how to react.
